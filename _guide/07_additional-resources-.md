Now that youâ€™ve completed the training. You can create an account at P2PU.org, and start your own learning circle.  If you are a project volunteer in Detroit  you can join the team of facilitators currently running learning circles.  To Join the team email [thepeople@p2pu.org](mailto:thepeople@p2pu.org)  let us know what library you work at and we can get you connected to the team. Once you join the team your learning circles will be posted on this website and you can join a larger network of facilitators working locally in Detroit and share best practices.

Happy Facilitating
