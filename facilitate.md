title: Facilitate
welcome:
 
    The Rocket Community Fund is bringing learning circles focused on digital literacy to Detroit in 2024! 

    Learning circles are free, interest-driven study groups that are led by a facilitator. The facilitator does not have to be an expert in the subject, so with a little practice and training, anybody can facilitate.

    If youâ€™re interested in participating, explore the resources below and contact us to get involved!
