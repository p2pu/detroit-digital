welcome: |
    (Partner name) is bringing learning circles to (city/country) in 2020! 

    Learning circles are free, interest-driven study groups that are led by a facilitator. The facilitator does not have to be an expert in the subject, so with a little practice and training, anybody can facilitate.

    If you’re interested in participating, explore the resources below and contact us to get involved!
